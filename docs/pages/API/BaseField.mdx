## BaseField

```js
import BaseField from 'uniforms/BaseField';

// You can't really render a BaseField because it doesn't have a render method.
// It's a base class of all packaged fields, so that all props below are available
// to all fields.
<BaseField
  // Field disabled state.
  //   It's passed directly to the field, but it propagates same as the label.
  disabled={false}
  // Field label.
  //   This prop has three modes. If you pass a string, then it will be used
  //   as a label. If you pass a null, then it won't have a label, but nested
  //   fields will have default labels. If you pass a non-null falsy value, it
  //   won't have a label and nested fields won't have labels too.
  label={true}
  // Field name.
  //   Used for identification. It should match your schema - if not, it will
  //   throw an error.
  name="field"
  // Field placeholder.
  //   If set to true, then a label will be used. Otherwise, it's handled like
  //   a label (including propagation).
  placeholder={false}
  // Field value.
  //   Every field accepts its specific value type only.
  value={value}

  // You can pass any prop but remember that passing onChange will "detach"
  // the field from the form in some way - it won't change your form state.
  // Also, passing any already provided prop - like id - will override the
  // default one.
