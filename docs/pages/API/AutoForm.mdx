## AutoForm

```js
import AutoForm from 'uniforms/AutoForm'; // Or from the theme package.

<AutoForm
  // Like onChange but for the whole model.
  //   Triggered just after onChange but with the next model instead of
  //   (key, value) pair.
  onChangeModel={model => console.log(model)}
/>;
```

**Note:** All `ValidatedQuickForm` props are also accepted and all methods are available.
