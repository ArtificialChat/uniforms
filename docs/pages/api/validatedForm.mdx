# `ValidatedForm`

```js
import ValidatedForm from 'uniforms/ValidatedForm'; // Or from the theme package.

<ValidatedForm
    // Additional asynchronous validation.
    //   Schema validation has to be sync, so this is the only way to achieve
    //   async validation.
    onValidate={(model, error, callback) => {
        // You can either ignore validation error...
        if (omitValidation(model)) {
            return callback(null);
        }

        // ...or any additional validation if an error is already there...
        if (error) {
            return callback();
        }

        // ...or feed it with another error.
        MyAPI.validate(model, error => callback(error || null));
    }}

    // Validation mode.
    //   By default, the form will start to validate from the time of the first
    //   submit and then revalidate on every change. It's 'onChangeAfterSubmit'.
    //   There are also 'onChange' and 'onSubmit' modes, but those are quite
    //   self-explanatory.
    validate="onChangeAfterSubmit"

    // Validator options.
    //   It's passed to getValidator of your schema bridge. It really depends on
    //   your schema.
    validator={{clean: true}}

    // Form methods.
    ref={form => {
        // Validate form with the current model.
        //   Returns a Promise, which rejects with an validation error or
        //   resolves without any value. Note, that it resolves/rejects AFTER
        //   the component is rerendered.
        form.validate();

        // Validate form with key set to value.
        //   You can use it to check, if a given value will pass the
        //   validation or not. Returns validation Promise, as described above.
        form.validate(key, value);

        // Validate form with the given model.
        //   Rather internal function. Returns validation Promise, as described
        //   above.
        form.validateModel(model);
    }}
/>
```

**Note:** All `BaseForm` props are also accepted and all methods are available.
