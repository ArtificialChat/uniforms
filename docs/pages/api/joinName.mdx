## joinName

```js
import joinName from 'uniforms/joinName';

// Use it to safely join partial field names. If you create a custom field with
// subfields, then it's better to use this helper.
const joinedNameString = joinName(nameA, nameB, nameC, ...);

// If you want to have a "raw" version of a name, then pass null as the first
// param.
const joinedNameArray = joinName(null, nameA, nameB, nameC, ...);
```
