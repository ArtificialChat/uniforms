# `createSchemaBridge`

```js
import createSchemaBridge from 'uniforms/createSchemaBridge';

// It's rather an internal helper, but it's still exported. Use it, if you want
// to manually create a schema bridge or to test your bridge. It will throw on
// an unrecognised schema.
const bridge = createSchemaBridge(schemaOrBridge);
```
