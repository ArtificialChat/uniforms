# Quick start

**Note:** The following examples are designed to work out of the box in meteor with `SimpleSchema` (a very common schema in the meteor community), but it's not mandatory and you can easily use it without meteor and with different schemas (see: [Custom Schema](#schemas)). There's also GraphQL and JSON Schema support.

Let's start with defining an example schema:

```js
// Choose your theme
import AutoForm from 'uniforms-unstyled/AutoForm';

// A compatible schema
import PostSchema from './schemas/Post';

// This will render an automatic, validated form, with labelled fields, inline
// validation and a submit button. If model will be present, form will be filled
// with appropriate values.
const PostForm = ({model}) =>
    <AutoForm schema={PostSchema} onSubmit={doc => db.save(doc)} model={model} />
;
```

That's all! `AutoForm` will generate a complete form with labelled fields, errors list (if any) and a submit button. Also, it will take care of validation and handle model changes.

If you want to have custom layout and/or structure inside your form you can include the form content.

```javascript
// Choose your theme
import AutoField   from 'uniforms-unstyled/AutoField';
import AutoForm    from 'uniforms-unstyled/AutoForm';
import SubmitField from 'uniforms-unstyled/SubmitField';
import TextField   from 'uniforms-unstyled/TextField';

// A compatible schema
import PostSchema from './schemas/Post';

const PostForm = ({model}) =>
    <AutoForm schema={PostSchema} onSubmit={doc => db.save(doc)} model={model}>
        <h2>Title</h2>

        <AutoField name="fieldA" />
        <TextField name="fieldB" />

        <div className="super-special-class">
            <SubmitField className="super-special-class-with-suffix" />
        </div>
    </AutoForm>
;
```
